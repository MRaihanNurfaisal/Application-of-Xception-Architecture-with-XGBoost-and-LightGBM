Project Overview :

This project is a local web-based image classification system that combines deep learning and gradient boosting techniques. The core engine utilizes Xception as a feature extractor, followed by LightGBM and XGBoost for classification. A lightweight Flask-based web interface was created to allow real-time testing of uploaded images locally, without requiring online deployment or hosting.

Project Objective :

Implement an effective hybrid model for image classification tasks.
Compare the performance between Xception-LGBM and Xception-XGBoost pipelines.
Provide an interactive testing platform through a local web application.
